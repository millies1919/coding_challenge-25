## Matt#8280 - Twitter Bot
Having enjoyed building Discord bots in Javascript, I have always wanted to experiment with building a twitter bot and #30DayProject 
seems like the ideal time. It should be an interesting project as I have never worked with the twitter API before. 
Im not 100% sure on the features yet, I will define that once I get to grips with the basics. Feel free to connect with me on 
Twitter/Linkedin, where I will likely document my journey alongside Discord!

## Brian(Brew)#9228 - Gatsby-Portfolio
I have been debating on creating a blog for a long time and decided I wanted to build it right into my portfolio.  My old portfolio used just html/css and javascript. In order to update it I decided to move it to gatsby so I could take advantage of react and some of the really nice things gatsby does for data and static pages

## Stealthiest#5812 - PokemonVGC Team Builder 
I've always loved playing competitive Pokemon on the Gameboy and now the Switch. Building teams is sopmething I love and I haven't found a online teambuilder that can check for type weaknesses in teams so I am going to try to implement this in mine. I plan to build the front end in React and then use Node and PostgreSQL to handle my backend
